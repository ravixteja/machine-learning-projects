# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Classical Machine Learning Algorith,s

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a robust credit card fraud detection system using classical machine learning algorithms, achieving 97.7% ROC-AUC and 74.3% F1-Score on the highly imbalanced Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

### Key Achievements

- **Balanced Classification**: 74.3% F1-Score with 75.3% precision and 73.3% recall
- **Robust Methodology**: End-to-end ML pipeline with proper evaluation techniques

## Dataset Information
- **Source**: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
- **Size**: 284,807 transactions
- **Features**: 30 features (28 PCA-transformed + Time + Amount + Class)
- **Class Imbalance**: 99.83% legitimate, 0.17% fraudulent transactions
- **Challenge**: Extreme class imbalance requiring specialized handling techniques

## Technical Approach

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Comprehensive statistical analysis of all 30 features
- Class distribution analysis revealing severe imbalance (1:577 ratio)
- Time-based pattern analysis across 48-hour transaction period
- Feature correlation and outlier detection

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Feature Selection**: Top 15 most discriminative features identified
- **Scaling**: RobustScaler applied to handle outliers effectively
- **Time-Aware Splitting**: 80/20 train-test split maintaining temporal order
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE oversampling with multiple strategies tested

### 3. Model Development
**Algorithms Evaluated:**
- Logistic Regression with L1/L2 regularization
- Decision Tree with class-weight balancing
- Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning

**Evaluation Strategy:**
- Stratified 5-fold cross-validation
- Business-focused metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
- Time-based validation to prevent data leakage
- Threshold optimization for cost-sensitive learning

### 4. Model Selection & Optimization
- Comprehensive comparison across sampling strategies
- Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV
- Business-cost optimization balancing investigation costs vs fraud losses
- Performance stability analysis across different scenarios

## Model Performance

### Final Model Metrics
| Metric | Score | Industry Benchmark | Status |
|--------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| **ROC-AUC** | **0.9766** | 0.90-0.95 | Exceptional |
| **F1-Score** | **0.7432** | 0.65-0.80 | Excellent |
| **Precision** | **0.7534** | 0.70-0.85 | Strong |
| **Recall** | **0.7333** | 0.65-0.80 | Good |

## Limitations & Deployment Considerations

### Technical Limitations
1. **PCA Feature Dependency**: Model requires 28 PCA-transformed features as inputs
2. **Feature Engineering Complexity**: Real-world deployment would need the original PCA transformation >
3. **Data Privacy**: Original features are anonymized, limiting practical interpretation
4. **Scalability**: Some algorithms (SVM) faced performance issues with large datasets

### Deployment Challenges
- **Real-time Implementation**: PCA transformed features in the dataset make it impractical for deployment (since user can't be asked to input values of PCA transformed features.)
- **Model Drift**: Performance may degrade as fraud patterns evolve

### Recommended Next Steps for Production
- Collect datasets containing raw and interpretable features.
- Then transfrom these features using PCA and train models on these PCA transformed features.
- During deployment, use the same PCA Transformer used during training, transform user imputs and then make a prediction.
